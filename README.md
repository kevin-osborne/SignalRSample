# SignalRSample

netcoreapp2.0 using the current signalr client js (1.0.0-preview2-30230) and server nuget package (1.0.0-preview1-final).

call the following api endpoint in fiddler/etc to generate logs:

http://localhost:5000/sample?id=1864acac-f2d5-4a12-b3a8-479885a2c868 

may take a couple of tries at first, and then the logs will show up in the home window at http://localhost:5000/

todo: get websockets to work and not just longpolling
